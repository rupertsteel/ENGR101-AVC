# ENGR101-AVC

All code goes into src/
All cad models goes into models/

We will be using CMake for the build system.
I will be making a readme on how to use CMake later on.

We will be using C++11/C++14 for the programming language, but we won't be using advanced features.

We will be planing on using unit testing later on.

The project plan is in google docs.

The IP for the pi is 10.140.45.62
