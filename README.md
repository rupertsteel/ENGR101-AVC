# ENGR101-AVC

All code goes into src/
All cad models goes into models/

We will be using CMake for the build system.
I will be making a readme on how to use CMake later on.

We will be using C++11/C++14 for the programming language, but we won't be using advanced features.

We will be planing on using unit testing later on.

The project plan is in google docs.
